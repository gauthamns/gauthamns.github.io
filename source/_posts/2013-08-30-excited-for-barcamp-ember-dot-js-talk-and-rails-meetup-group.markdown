I'm pretty excited and happy about my open source initiatives for this month.

I was surprised that there is no Rails meetup in Bangalore. Rails is exciting!! More I use Rails, more I fall in love. A very well thought framework indeed. So I just went ahead and created one. I hope the community drives it forward. 

More I use Ember.js, more I'm convinced of the potential of Javascript MVC frameworks. While Ember is still not a finished product (lots of polishing is required. And can do with good docs too.) I'm giving a session on Ember in Barcamp Bangalore on Sept 14th.
