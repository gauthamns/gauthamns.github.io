AppleInsider wrote a lengthy article stating Google is ditching Android!! It's a classic example of coming to a conclusion first and then looking for evidence. The article here: http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/29/google-appears-ready-to-ditch-android-over-its-intellectual-property-issues . Last article I've read in AppleInsider!! What a joke of an article!! It was actually fun reading all wrong conclusions :D

Why? Because Android is not making money. Why? Intellectual issues. Why? Samsung's dominance. Why? Decelerated progress?. Why? Chromecast not named Androidcast!! Hahaha!!

Android not making money? Seriously? That is why Microsoft spending billions popularizing Windows phone, firefox coming up with firefox os, Canonical, Ubuntu for phones. Android will make tons of money. From Motorola's hardware division, from Google services like email, app engine, from search etc etc. Do you think other divisions of Microsoft like Microsoft office would have been as popular as they have been if it were a standalone product?

Intellectual issues? Microsoft had to pay so much in legal fines, so much bad press, bad blood I would say. Did they give up on Windows? Given that that was their main product but Android is not so for Google. But Android will be central to Google's bigger aspirations. to become more than just a search engine.

Samsung's dominance? That is a cause for concern. Google should do something about it. But abondoning because of it? I believe with Google need not worry about Samsung's dominance. Samsung's software is just pathetic. Touchwiz is such a mess (not about extra features, mind you). They can never become a software company in the near future. And with Google play services, Google has made it extremely difficult to fork Android and be successful.

Decelerated progress? Seriously? Let's take a look at what's new in the last year in Android. New location services, Game center for Android, design standardization, exciting hardware at affordable cost (Nexus 4), and finally Android 4.3. Google is now adding many of the features through Google play services instead through Android versions. Advantages: No need to wait for the new Android version to make it to the phone, make it harder to fork Android(for Google!!)

Chromecast? Hahaha.. Chrome head. Business decisions. I'm not commenting on that. Nor am I going to read too much into it.

Chrome head now leading Android? Sundar Pichai is credited with resounding success of Chrome browser. Google will be hoping he takes Android to new heights. Not so that he will kill the popular OS and try and make Chrome OS popular.
